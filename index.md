I'm a fan of Github Pages for the possibilities it offers to anyone to publish a website for free. I have multiple projects that could be of interest if that's your case too:

* [Easy Markdown to Github Pages](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/)
* [Parcel Github Pages Boilerplate](https://github.com/nicolas-van/parcel-github-pages-boilerplate)
